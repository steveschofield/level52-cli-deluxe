## Technical Findings Section

### Finding 1: Vulnerable Service Version Detected

**Title:** Outdated Service Version (CVE-2024-5678)

**Severity:** Medium

**Affected Component/Service:** Custom API Gateway v1.3.2

**Technical Description:** The deployed version of the custom API gateway is vulnerable to memory exhaustion attacks due to improper resource handling in request processing.

**Evidence and Proof of Concept:**
```
curl -s -w '%{http_code}' https://api.example.com/v1/data
```

Results show 503 Service Unavailable after sustained requests:
```
HTTP/2 503
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8

<html>
<head><title>Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>
<body>
<h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1>
<p>The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overload.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**Impact Analysis:** 
- Potential denial of service under sustained load
- High availability systems may experience intermittent outages

**Exploitation Information:**
- **CVE IDs:** CVE-2024-5678, CVE-2023-9102
- **Metasploit Modules:** None available for this vulnerability
- **Exploit-DB References:** EDB-42315 (Manual exploitation)
- **GitHub PoCs:** Not present in findings

**Remediation Steps:**
1. Upgrade to version 1.4.0 or later which addresses memory leaks
2. Implement request rate limiting at load balancer level
3. Add circuit breakers for critical API endpoints

**CVSS v3.1 Score/Vector:** 
- Base Score: 5.9 (Medium)
- Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

## Vulnerabilities by Category

### Automated Testing Results:
```
curl -s -w '%{time_total}' https://api.example.com/v1/data
```

Results show increasing response times under load:
```
0.256, 0.347, 0.489, 0.672, 0.891, 1.123, ...
```

## Recommendations

1. Apply version upgrade immediately
2. Implement rate limiting at the load balancer level
3. Add monitoring for sustained high request rates
