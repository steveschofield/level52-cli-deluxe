## Alerts

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:3000`

**Description**: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

---

### 2. Cross-Domain Misconfiguration

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:3000`

**Evidence**: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`

**Description**: Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server.

**Solution**: Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).
Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.

CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### 103. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:3000/juice-shop/node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js:365:14`

**Description**: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### 151. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:3000/juice-shop/build/routes/assets/public/favicon_js.ico`

**Description**: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### 303. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:3000/juice-shop/build/routes/assets/public/polyfills.js`

**Description**: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

### 348. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:3000/juice-shop/node_modules/express/lib/router/assets/public/polyfills.js`

**Description**: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
