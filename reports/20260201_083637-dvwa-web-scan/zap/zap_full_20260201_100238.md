## Alerts

### 1. Session Management Response Identified

**Risk**: INFORMATIONAL | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280`

**Evidence**: `PHPSESSID`

**Description**: The given response has been identified as containing a session management token. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of header tokens that can be used in the Header Based Session Management Method. If the request is in a context which has a Session Management Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the session management to use the tokens identified.

**Solution**: This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

---

### 2. Cookie No HttpOnly Flag

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280`

**Evidence**: `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID`

**Description**: A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.

**Solution**: Ensure that the HttpOnly flag is set for all cookies.

---

### 3. Cookie No HttpOnly Flag

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280`

### 4. Cookie without SameSite Attribute

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280`

**Evidence**: `Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID`

**Description**: A cookie has been set without the SameSite attribute, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.

**Solution**: Ensure that the SameSite attribute is set to either 'lax' or ideally 'strict' for all cookies.

---

### 5. Cookie without SameSite Attribute

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280`

**Evidence**: `Set-Cookie: security`

### 6. Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280`

**Evidence**: `Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)`

**Description**: The web/application server is leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress the "Server" header or provide generic details.

---

### 7. Session Management Response Identified

**Risk**: INFORMATIONAL | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/login.php`

**Evidence**: `PHPSESSID`

**Description**: The given response has been identified as containing a session management token. The 'Other Info' field contains a set of header tokens that can be used in the Header Based Session Management Method. If the request is in a context which has a Session Management Method set to "Auto-Detect" then this rule will change the session management to use the tokens identified.

**Solution**: This is an informational alert rather than a vulnerability and so there is nothing to fix.

---

### 8. Missing Anti-clickjacking Header

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/login.php`

**Description**: The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

**Solution**: Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

**Description**: The web/application server is leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress the "Server" header or provide generic details.

---

### 10. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/dvwa/css/login.css`

**Description**: The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

**Solution**: Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

---

### 11. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/login.php`

**Description**: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

**Solution**: Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

**Solution**: Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### 88. Missing Anti-clickjacking Header

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/dvwa/images/?C=M;O=A`

**Description**: The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

**Solution**: Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

### 124. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/dvwa/includes/dvwaPage.inc.php`

**Description**: The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

**Solution**: Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/instructions.php`

**Description**: The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

**Solution**: Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

### 165. Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/about.php`

**Evidence**: `Apache/2.4.25 (Debian)`

**Description**: The web/application server is leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress the "Server" header or provide generic details.

---

### 166. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/about.php`

**Description**: The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

**Solution**: Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

---

### 167. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

**Risk**: MEDIUM | **Confidence**: High

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/instructions.php`

**Description**: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

**Solution**: Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### 170. X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing

**Risk**: LOW | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/instructions.php`

**Description**: The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'.

### 179. SQL Injection

**Risk**: HIGH | **Confidence**: Medium

**URL**: `http://192.168.1.12:5280/setup.php`

**Description**: SQL injection may be possible.

**Solution**: Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place.
In general, type check all data on the server side.
If the application uses JDBC, use PreparedStatement or CallableStatement, with parameters passed by '?'
If the application uses ASP, use ADO Command Objects with strong type checking and parameterized queries.
If database Stored Procedures can be used, use them.
Do *not* concatenate strings into queries in the stored procedure, or use 'exec', 'exec immediate', or equivalent functionality!
Do not create dynamic SQL queries using simple string concatenation.
Escape all data received from the client.
Apply an 'allow list' of allowed characters, or a 'deny list' of disallowed characters in user input.
Apply the principle of least privilege by using the least privileged database user possible.
In particular, avoid using the 'sa' or 'db-owner' database users. This does not eliminate SQL injection, but minimizes its impact.
Grant the minimum database access that is necessary for the application.
